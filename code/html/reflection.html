                    Learning to code has been an epic journey. We feel like the skills we have gained are going to be really useful. We have learned to use both java, html and css. Through obligatory assignments and weekly optional assignments, we got a bunch of useful experience.
                    <br>
                    <br> However, we know that we still have a lot to learn. This final assigment has really forced us to innovate and be creative. We are really excited about learning more about coding. We are confident that this is only the beginning
                    of our journey. This is only the tip of the iceberg, we cannot wait to discover the rest.

                    Making the change from upper-secondary school to university was not an easy task for anyone in our group. We are all first-year students who have not had any previous experience studying in university. There were multiple challenges that came with transitioning
                    from a structured daily school to a more open university style of learning. One major challenge that we all felt during the start of the semester was figuring out were information was on Canvas.

                <p class="contentText">
                    Managing workload was very difficult when we could not figure out where information was located. This was in combination with not understanding what the end goal of each subject was, and what we needed to understand to get there. <br>                    <br> Now that we are in university, there is much more freedom for you to study however you like, and no one is responsible for your learning. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is great for finding a schedule for you, but no
                    one is there to get you back on track if you have fallen behind in a subject.
